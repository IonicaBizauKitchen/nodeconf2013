# Format

Content is broken in to *sessions*. A *session* is intended to deliver new knowledge to attendees as well as give them hands-on experience using that knowledge. Session creators are free to mix short form traditional presentations with group activities and assignments.

Each *session* begins on the hour. This means that a session is about 55 minutes in length because of the expected time for many attendees to make it to the next session.

Eight session should be run concurrently. ~40 attendees will be in each session and all attendees are schedule to attend every session. Between 1 and 4 camp counselors should be in each session to help answer questions work attendees through the assignments.

When attendees register they will receive their schedule. The grouping is not "static," attendees will get mixed up between each session.

We have several spaces, all with their own constraints, and we can layout the tables, chairs, and projection as you wish. The sooner session leaders can define their requirements the sooner we can make assign each space to a session.

All attendees will preinstall the `nodeconf2013` npm package. The npm package includes relevant dependencies and materials for a session. We don't want to give away what the session are about so do not include any detailed planning in the package, just the required dependencies and anything else you might need to help them like static file servers. We'll also have usb sticks with the package so that if the internet goes out we can still access any required materials so please include relevant documentation.

Session are color coded. Do not share the color code keys with attendees, these codes are only so that each session can have a place to put relevant materials and a starting point for the people to write code in their session, they may be changed in the future and may not be public.
