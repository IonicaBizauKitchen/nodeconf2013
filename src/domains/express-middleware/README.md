Write your domain-enhanced error-handling middleware in domain-errors.js. You
can use `npm start` to run the Express service (read the source for the
available routes), and you can use either `curl` if you've got it, or the
bundled installation of `uncurl`, invokable via `./node_modules/.bin/uncurl`.
